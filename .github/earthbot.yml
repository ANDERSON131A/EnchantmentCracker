  64bitjava: This issue is commonly caused by not having 64-bit Java on your system. Please run `java -version` in `cmd` to check if you are using 32-bit. If this command does not specify whether you are using 32-bit or 64-bit, then you are using 32-bit. If you are, use [this link](https://javadl.oracle.com/webapps/download/AutoDL?BundleId=239858_230deb18db3e4014bb8e3e8324f81b43) to install 64-bit Java, then try running the Enchantment Cracker again.\nIf this doesn't work, paste the output of `java -version` here so we know that you have tried it.
  modded: The Enchantment Cracker is not guaranteed to work on a modded server. If you ask your server admin for a world download, run the world in singleplayer, and the Enchantment Cracker works, then the mods are causing the problem. In particular, PaperMC is known to break Enchantment Cracking. Modded servers will never be supported.
  failed: "This is usually caused by you doing one of a number of disallowed actions, such as sprinting, eating or being in beacon range. The Enchantment Cracker itself is not able to give any further information, so review the [list of disallowed actions](https://github.com/Earthcomputer/EnchantmentCracker/wiki/Tutorial#how-to-use-the-tool) and make sure you aren't doing any of them.\nIf you're really stuck, if you're on Minecraft 1.14 or newer you can install [clientcommands](https://github.com/Earthcomputer/clientcommands) which is a client-side mod and has a built-in Enchantment Cracker (so no need to use this one), and can give you more detailed information about where you're going wrong. You first have to enable `/ctemprule set enchantingPrediction true`, then use the built-in Enchantment Cracker in much the same way as you would use this one. Also run `/ctemprule set playerRNGMaintenance false` for more error catching. This mod requires the Fabric mod loader AND the Fabric API."
